The app/public/lib directory contains various dojo directories:

dojo-release-1.5.0-src = the base dojo dir for our 1.5.0 support

dojo-1.5.0 = the 'standard' profile built with full optimizations.  For use by buckets.

dojo-1.5.0-nooptimize = the 'standard' profile build with no optimizations.  For use by buckets.

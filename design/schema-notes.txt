Bucket Theory
-------------

A bucket is a combination of html, js, css and resources required to run in the
sandbox.

Each bucket exists in a namespace, and has a unique ID.  The namespace for
public buckets is 'public'.  A user must have a unique username, and the
namespace for a users buckets is their username.  So, example bucket IDs are:

/public/1234
/public/zyxa
/wuhi/1234
/neekfenwick/qwerty

When a user is not logged on, the public namespace is presumed, thus '1234' is
taken to mean '/public/1234'.  When logged on as wuhi, '1234 is taken to mean
'/wuhi/1234'.  The url to a bucket must either include a namespace, or if no
namespace is provided, 'public' is presumed, thus

http://dojo-sandbox.net/1234
and
http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234

refer to the same bucket.

Note that 'public' is therefore an illegal username.  A dummy 'public' users
entry will always exist.

A Bucket always has a latest version number, which corresponds to the version
number of the most recently created version.

A new bucket will have only one version, and
http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234
refers to that bucket.  Incrementing the version number gives
http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234/1


Buckets and Resources
----------------------------
A Bucket should be an all in one package. So it should contain all resources that it needs to run.
e.g. .HTML files or .JSON/.XML
There is no need for a real "filesystem". A resource should just have a unique name. Maybe a prefix could work like a directory. e.b. HTML/template.html

Not sure how to handle the calls ... 
	- http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234/4/HTML/template.html
Maybe we should prohibit the Slash in the resourcename?!
	
External resources are forbidden. Exceptions are: Cross Domain Builds of dojo and it's Stylesheets
Maybe some other external scripts like firebug-lite?

Note we cannot avoid including external scripts in html pane by using a script-tag...

We should limit the number or size of the resources!


WYSIWYG Editor
---------------------
Based on the visual designer ( http://dojo.nod.at/designer/release/ ) it should be possible to edit resource files and the html-pane.
The goal is to provide a helper by creating templates for widgets.

TODO WYSIWYG Editor
-----------------------------
Create a smaller version that is configured to use dijit._Templated specific properties like dojoAttachPoint and events.
Do some enhancements on the position system. Most widgets are using positin:relative. The Editor mostly uses position: absolute


TODO Web Server Redirects
-------------------------

If would be useful if, when no version number is provided in the URL, the
latest version number is presumed.  For example, if the public bucket 1234 has
a latestVersion of 4, then the original URL of
http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234
should redirect the user to the /4 version.

This means that when a URL is entered that matches the bucket schema, some
redirecting must happen in the context of the database.  Thus, simple
.htaccess style rewriting is not sufficient.  For example, entering:

http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234
should cause the script to look up bucket 1234, discover its latestVersion
number, and issue a browser redirect to:
http://dojo-sandbox.net/public/1234/4

Database Schema
---------------

table user {
  username TINYTEXT NOT NULL
}

table bucket {
  namespace TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- fk to users.username
  id TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- unique id of this bucket, in its namespace
  name TINYTEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_version int NOT NULL,
  primary key (namespace, id)
}

table bucket_version {
  namespace TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- fk to users.username
  id TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- unique id of this bucket, in its namespace
  version int NOT NULL,
  dojo_version TINYTEXT NOT NULL,
  resources TEXT NOT NULL, -- '##' separated resources
  content_html TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_js TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_css TEXT NOT NULL,
  dj_config TEXT NOT NULL,
  primary key (namespace, id)
}

-- TODO Think this through!
table bucket_resource {
  namespace TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- fk to users.username
  id TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- unique id of this bucket, in its namespace
  version int NOT NULL,
  type TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- 'html', 'json' .. umm, what?
  name TINYTEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g. 'http://myserver.com/data.json'
  primary key (namespace, id, version)
}

Example Data
------------

INSERT INTO bucket VALUES
( 'public', '1234', 'First bucket', 'long desc', 0);

INSERT INTO bucket_version VALUES
( 'public', '1234', 0, '1.5.0cdn', '/HTML/myWidget.html

{
		"id": xxx,
		"title": "first paste",
		"description": "longer text here",
		"latestVersion": 0,
		"versions": [
				{
						"version": 0,
						"dojoVersion": "1.5.0cdn",
						"resources": [
								{
										"name": "/HTML/myWidget.html"
								},
								{
										"name": "/JSON/myData.json"
								}
						],
						"contentHtml": "<div></div>",
						"contentJs": "dojo.ready(function(){});",
						"contentCss": "",
						"djConfig": {
								"parseOnLoad": true
						}
				}
		]
}

		<h1>dojo-sandbox changelog</h1><p>A brief history of changes.</p>
		<h2>Jan 2013</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed 'Fork' so it retains your login namespace and doesn't dump new bucket in 'public' if you are logged in.</li>
			<li>Built and deployed dojo 1.8.2, 1.8.3.</li>
			<li>Hid the 'Layers' controls, they don't make sense since we moved to the 1.7.x build system.</li>
			<li>Note: the 'Cannot save - Do you want to fork?' dialog that appears when you are looking at someone else's namespace (e.g. a template) and try to Save does not work.  Please just close that dialog and hit Fork manually for now.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Jan 2013</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added Templates.  'template' is a special namespace containing example buckets you can use as a base for your development.  Combined with the Fork ability, they make starting a more complex bucket much easier.  Just select a template name from the 'Template' dropdown in the toolbar to go to a template, edit it and Run it as much as you want, and Fork it to create your own copy of it.</li>
			<li>Fixed login?  You ought to be able to sign up and log in again.</li>
		</ul>
